This program will output "Hello World" and is the first basic program everyone should complete in Java.

We create a class named "Main" by using "public class Main".

Using "public static void main(String[] args)" we are able to indentify where/who can access the assosciated method, what the method returns, and where the program begins.

"System.out.println" allows the program to output any argument passed to it. In this scenario it prints "Hello World!"
